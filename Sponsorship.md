# Sponsorship

1. Purpose:
This policy aims to facilitate clear, prompt, and equitable determinations of proposed sponsorships without necessitating extensive debate or uncertainty.
Nonetheless, the Foundation retains the right to decline sponsorship through a Board vote in cases where it would impede the Foundation's mission.

2. Scope:
This policy applies to all sponsorships at official NixOS events.
This encompasses event sponsors as well as companies delivering talks, hosting booths, etc.
Additionally, this policy extends to sponsorship messages within Nixpkgs itself or other official resources such as documentation and the homepage.

3. Rules for Sponsors:
The list of rules may be expanded or modified in the future as necessary to reflect the current decision-making process.

    1. Sponsors must be individuals or organizations that are legally able to operate in compliance with the laws and policies of their own origin, that of the NixOS Foundation, and of relevant third-party agreements.
    2. Sponsorship links, materials, and content must be suitable for minors and work environments and should align with the Foundation's mission.
    3. Event organizers may impose additional rules for event sponsorships, such as setting a theme or requiring a specific local affiliation.

4. Procedures

    1. The Sponsor Chair will submit sponsorship proposals to the Selection Committee via email, composed of the event organizers and the Foundation Board.

    2. Selection Committee members shall be notified at least 2 weeks prior to the event and provided with at least 1 week to submit objections to the Foundation Board via email.

    3. Objections should be specific to the sponsor and cite relevant reasons why the sponsorship would impede the NixOS mission.
    If at least two (2) objections are received, the sponsor will be subjected to a general vote by the Selection Committee.

    4. A sponsor will be accepted unless:

        1. A majority (>50%) of the event organizers vote to decline the sponsor, or
        2. A majority (>50%) of the Foundation Board vote to decline the sponsor.
