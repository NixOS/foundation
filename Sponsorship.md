# Sponsorship

1. Purpose:
This policy aims to facilitate clear, prompt, and equitable determinations of proposed sponsorships without necessitating extensive debate or uncertainty.
Nonetheless, the Foundation retains the right to decline sponsorship through a Board vote in cases where it would impede the Foundation's mission.

2. Scope:
This policy applies to all sponsorships at official NixCon events.
This encompasses event sponsors as well as companies delivering talks, hosting booths, etc.
Additionally, this policy extends to sponsorship messages within Nixpkgs itself or other official resources such as documentation and the homepage.

3. Rules for Sponsors:
The list of rules may be expanded or modified in the future as necessary to reflect the current decision-making process.

    1. Sponsors must be individuals or organizations that are legally able to operate in compliance with the laws and policies of their own origin, that of the NixOS Foundation, and of relevant third-party agreements.
    2. Sponsorship links, materials, and content must be suitable for minors and work environments and should align with the Foundation's mission.
    3. Event organizers may impose additional rules for event sponsorships, such as setting a theme or requiring a specific local affiliation.

4. The Selection Committee will be composed of:
    - 2 representatives from the event organizers
    - 1 representative from the Foundation Board
    - 1 representative from the Moderation team
    - 1 representative from the Marketing team

5. Procedures

    1. The event organizers will submit sponsorship proposals to the Selection Committee via email.

    2. Selection Committee members shall be notified at least 2 weeks prior to the event and provided with at least 1 week to submit objections to committee members in written form.

    3. Objections should be specific to the sponsor and cite relevant reasons why the sponsorship would impede the NixOS mission.

    4. If a consensus cannot be reached through discussion, the objection shall be brought to a vote.
    The sponsor will be accepted if a strong majority of the committee votes to accept the sponsor.
