- Dedicate https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/ to discuss community governance _exclusively_
- The [permissions](https://docs.zulip.com/help/roles-and-permissions) are as follows
  - Organization owners: Board members
  - Organization admins: Board observers
  - Moderators: Moderation team, board observers and @infinisil
    - In addition to the CoC, they will ensure it's only used for governance discussions
  - The conversations are publicly readable to anyone, but joining the conversation requires a one-time approval (see below)

- To join the discussion on Zulip, users have three options:
  - If you have contributed to the Nix ecosystem, post a message containing a link to your contribution. The exact kind of contribution does not matter, as long as it is _before 2024-05-01_.
  - If you have made a substantial and constructive contribution to setting up a successful community-based governance structure, post a message with a link to your contribution
  - If you do not qualify for the above, but still believe you could contribute, reach out to the Zulip moderators in private on Discourse

- To post a message:
  - If your contribution was on GitHub, post it to {dedicated foundation Github issue}
  - If it was not on Github, post it to {Discourse thread}
  - The message might look like:
    Contribution: [some-link]
    Email: [some-email]
  - As soon as a Zulip moderator has confirmed your contribution, they'll send an invite
    - They'll check that the contribution is from the same user and that it happened before 2024-05-01

- Should banned people be allowed to join?
  - Yes, but they get one shot to be in the conversation, with extreme prejudice
  - If they blow it, it's a permaban (for all community platforms, not just Zulip)
