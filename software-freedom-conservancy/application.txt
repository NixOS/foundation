Conservancy's Evaluation Committee meets monthly.  While I cannot
guarantee your project will be evaluated in a specific month (the meeting
lasts one hour and we push through as many application as we can), getting
your application in by the end of any given month means that at least your
project will be on the agenda for the following month's meeting.  You
project will of course stay on the agenda until the Evaluation Committee
gets to it.

The Software Freedom Conservancy encourages your project to apply for
Conservancy.  Please be advised that applying doesn't guarantee your
project can join Conservancy; it's simply the first step in the process
of joining Conservancy.

Please note that Conservancy currently has a long queue for project
applications, so we cannot assure you when you will receive a response to
your application.  Feel free to ping Conservancy at any time to inquire
about the status of your application.

To apply to the Conservancy, please answer fully all the questions below,
in a *single* text-only (i.e., not HTML) email to
<apply@sfconservancy.org>.  Please try to be as concise as possible while
making sure to answer the questions fully.

If the relevant information is already gathered and publicly available,
it's ok to include URLs as answers.  However, if a given URL has lots of
information on it, please make sure that you direct us specifically to
the portions of the web page loaded by the given URL that are relevant in
answering the question.

Conservancy Application Questions:

*** Why does your project want to join Conservancy?  Specifically, what
    benefits do you expect to take advantage of immediately and within a
    few years?

Primarily tools and processes to receive tax-advantaged contributions
for the project, plus help with fundraising to support our
infrastructure and providing transparency reports.

Additionally, helping us manage the rapid growth of our community.

*** Conservancy does encourage projects to apply to multiple non-profit
    homes to find the best fit.  Does your project have an application
    pending with any other non-profit homes?  What do you see as the pros
    and cons of the various organizations you've applied to?

We have talked with NLNet about being homed under them. They would be
happy to do so, however their model makes it challenging to receive
regular and smaller contributions.

We also have run our own foundation, the NixOS Foundation, however it
is not not-for-profit, and transparency reporting is not a nice way to
spend contributor time.

*** Please give a detailed description of the project.

NixOS is a Linux distribution based around the Nix build system.

Most of the project's activity is around Nixpkgs, a package set that
works both in NixOS but also Darwin and other Linux distributions. We
also develop complementary tools:

 - NixOps which allows easy deployment of NixOS onto various cloud
   environments

 - Hydra, a custom CI that is used to test and build the large number
   of packages that we have.

Organizationally, Eelco Dolstra is the creator of Nix and our BDFL.

A Nix Core Team is established for shepherding the Nix project.

Beyond that, an informal group of developers take on various
responsibilities.

In terms of infrastructure, we use GitHub to host the code at
https://github.com/NixOS. We have a mix of dedicated and virtualised
hardware for our build infrastructure and website, which is provided
by various companies.

*** What FLOSS License(s) does your project use?  Please include the
    primary license, and list other licenses for code that is included.
    (e.g., "The project as a whole is GPLv3-or-later, but about a dozen
    files in the directory src/external/ are under the Apache-2.0
    license").  Please be sure to include information on documentation
    licensing as well as software licensing.

 - Nix the build tool is released under LGPL 2.1
 - Nixpkgs, the main package set used by the community (where most
   user contributions occur, and also contains all NixOS code and
   documentation) is under the MIT license
 - Hydra, the shared CI server, is released under GPLv3
 - NixOps, the infrastructure management tool, is released under LGPLv3
 - Nix Pills, a standalone set of documentation, is licensed
   CC-BY-SA-4.0

*** Please give us your roadmap and plans for future development of the
    project, including both code and community plans.

Overall:

 - Reduce the bus-factor of Eelco by creating an Infrastructure team
 - Make our RFC process more effective

Nix:

 - Improving the usability and internal consistency of the tool, to be
   easier to learn
 - Improve the error messages and diagnostics

Nixpkgs:

 - Improve the organization of the security team, and reliably publish
   advisories for patches
 - Become a member of the embargoed openwall security distros list
 - Become a strong, viable alternative to Homebrew on macOS
 - Bring the usual determinism, security, and maintainability benefits
   of Nix to a broader audience.
 - Develop an active Documentation team for maintaining and reviewing
   documentation across the Nix ecosystem.
 - Appoint people to have roles and responsibilities to specific
   subsections of the Nix ecosystem
 - Empower package maintainers to more easily manage the packages they
   maintain

Community:
 - Our last two NixCon conferences have been a great success, with
   quite sizable growth. We plan on continuing to have yearly NixCon
   events.

 - Continue developing and fostering a diverse, friendly, and
   welcoming community.

*** Please give us the main link to the projects primary website.

https://nixos.org

*** Please give us a URL to a code repository we can clone and/or
    checkout.

 - https://github.com/NixOS/nix.git
 - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs.git

*** Have you ever had funds held by the project, or by any individual on
    behalf of the project?  How and for what did you spend those funds?
    Are there funds remaining?  If so, who is holding them now?

Funds are currently held by the NixOS foundation, registered in the
Netherlands: https://nixos.org/nixos/foundation.html

They are primarily used to pay for Mac infrastructure costs, and some
infrastructure which is not otherwise covered by a sponsor.

Currently hydra.nixos.org is the community CI server and builds
artifacts used by the majority of Nix and NixOS users. This is
currently provided for free by a major NixOS-using company.

We also have a substantial amount of donated hardware for the build
server.

*** Do you have any ongoing fundraising programs for your project?  How do
    they operate, and how much funding is brought in through these mechanisms
    currently?  Where do you expect most of your donor base to be
    geographically?

Our fundraising is fairly minimal, with a small amount of money coming
in each month. You can see some information about that on
https://nixos.org/nixos/foundation.html

Most of our donor base is still probably in Europe, although there is
growing interest to in US companies providing sponsorship.

*** Going forward, once inside Conservancy, how do you expect to spend funds
    that you raise?  What types of activity do you want to ask Conservancy to
    take on your behalf?  Where geographically do you want those activities
    to take place?

Infrastructure costs will probably remain a majority of the
expenditures.

Some possible new things to fund:

 - certain types of development work as deemed necessary by the
   community. For example, last year the community funded an effort to
   remove legacy perl remnants from the Nix build tool.
 - supporting a team to handle security patching, or other
   community-wide projects
 - designers
 - conferences

Geographically speaking, mostly in the EU and US.

*** Is your project able and willing to participate in fundraising
    campaigns with Conservancy on an annual or perhaps more frequent
    basis?

Yes.

*** Does your project owe funds to anyone?

No.

*** Who currently holds your projects' trademarks, if any?  When was your
    projects' name first used, and who used it?

There are no formal trademarks.

The name was first used for the project by Eelco Dolstra in 2003.

*** Does you project have a logo?  If so, who drew it, when did they draw
    it, where is it displayed and what is its license?

Yes, it was created by Simon Frankau and updated by Tim Cuthbertson.

It is displayed:

 - https://nixos.org/
 - https://github.com/nixos

It is licensed Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License:

*** Are you aware of anyone in your project, individual or company,
    holding a patent in any jurisdiction that are in any way related to
    your project?

No.

*** Has your project ever had legal trouble, been involved in legal
    proceedings or received a letter accusing your project of patent,
    copyright, trademark or other types of infringement?

No.

*** Please give a brief history of the project, focusing on how the
    community developed and the general health of the community.  Be sure
    to include information on any forks or other disputes that have
    occurred in the community.

The Nix project was started by Eelco Dolstra in 2003/2004 as part of
his Ph.D. work. For a few years following that, it had a small but
enthusiastic following. It started gaining more attention in the past
5 years as it started to gain support for large swaths of packages
from the Haskell ecosystem (drawing in lots of Haskell users with
similar tastes) and others.

NixOS is originally by Armijn Hemel, as part of his MSc project in
2007.

The biggest "fork" is Guix, which arose from a contingent of the
community wanting a more GNU-flavored approach to package management,
with the same theoretical underpinning, but with a different front-end
language and a different policy for software inclusion (strongly
preferring or even requiring copyleft software). The Guix project is
still small but doing quite well under the GNU umbrella.

A more recent small fork called Triton arose when two members of the
community disagreed with how packaging should work. It's still very
active but hasn't grown much more developer capacity since the fork.

*** Please explain how your project is governed.  Who makes the decisions
    in the project?  How do you resolve disputes, particularly about
    non-code issues?

Eelco Dolstra serves as an overall BDFL, however responsibilities have
been distributed.

 - Nix the build tool has a Nix Core Team as documented in
   https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0025-nix-core-team.md
 - We have an RFC process at https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/ which has
   not historically worked very well, but after a summit in June 2018
   is being revitalized through specific improvements.
 - Most technical discussions occur either on GitHub tickets, the
   mailing list, or RFCs.

*** Does your project currently offer, or wish to offer any consulting or
    training services (such as deployment, administration or other such
    services of the software for users) to your user base?  If so, how do
    you structure (or seek to structure) this work?

No, however some members of the community offer consulting through
their own businesses and we do link to them from the website.

*** Is anyone in the project currently offering a Software as a Service
    system based on project?  If so, how is that offering governed,
    coordinated and is the software that runs the service made fully
    available to your users?

Yes,

 - chillcode.io
 - ci.enlambda.com
 - cachix.org

among others. These aren't coordinated by the community and are
independent companies.

*** If your project runs on Linux-based systems, please list all the
    distributions that include your project, and what "repository area"
    the package appears in.  If you aren't packaged for any major
    distributions, please tell us why you believe your project hasn't been
    packaged yet.

We choose not to make RPMs or DEBs because they inherently conflict
with our distribution and packaging model. We think this question is
more revealing for software which isn't a build tool and package
manager.

However, note, you can install Nix through the Arch Linux AUR and
Homebrew.

*** Does your project have any existing for-profit or non-profit
    affiliations, funding relationships, or other agreements between the
    project and/or key leaders of your project and other organizations?
    Has the project had such affiliations in the past?  Please list of all
    of them in detail and explain their nature. Even tangential
    affiliations and relationships, or potential affiliations that you
    plan to create should be included.

*** Approximately how many users does your project have, and what items
    lead you to believe your userbase is of a particular size (e.g., post
    counts to your user mailing list)?

*** Please list the names, email addresses, and affiliations (e.g.,
    employer) of key developers and major contributors.  Include both
    current and past contributors and developers.  Please include date
    ranges of when those developers/contributors were active.

    Please make this list as extensive and complete as possible.  You need
    not include every last person who sent one patch, but please include
    at least those who regularly sent patches or were/are regular
    contributors.  If you project has contributors who have been inactive
    for more than five years, you need only to list such inactive
    contributors if they made substantial contributions.

*** Please include any other pertinent information not given above that
    you feel we should review with your application.

Please note that your answers will be shared with Conservancy's Board of
Directors, its Evaluation Committee (the membership of which is
published on Conservancy's website), and with some of Conservancy's
existing member projects leaders.  We like to get as much input as
possible from Conservancy's existing project base when evaluating new
projects for membership.

Please submit the application in pure ASCII format, with paragraph fills
and line breaks designed for 80 column viewing.  You don't need to
impress us with formatting; what will actually impress us is if you make
the information presented in a simple and clear way that is easily read
and understood when edited with GNU Emacs and emailed around internally
at Conservancy via standard email forwarding tools.

Before completing your application, please be sure to read our
application FAQ at: http://sfconservancy.org/members/apply/

Feel free to include any additional information you'd like us to review
in considering an application, but please try to be brief as possible.

Please note that Conservancy does require that projects consider donating
a percentage of their funding to the general operating costs of the
Conservancy.  This is a way to assure we can continue providing a high
level of service to all Conservancy projects.  We'll discuss this further
and in detail after the evaluation process.

Please be advised that you may get follow-up clarification questions on
your application.  Please be prepared to respond to these inquiries
quickly to assure timely processing of your application.
