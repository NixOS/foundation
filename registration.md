# Foundation registration updates

As given in the [impressum](./impressum.md), the foundation is registered at the [KVK (chamber of commerce)](https://www.kvk.nl/).

Most foundation changes are easier with a [BSN (citizen service number)](https://business.gov.nl/regulation/citizen-service-number/).
A BSN both allows you to use the Netherland's [DigiD online services](https://www.digid.nl/en),
and to be registered with the foundation more easily.

You can get a BSN even if you're not a citizen.
As such, all board members are recommended to have one.

## Getting a BSN as a non-citizen

As a non-citizen, you can get a BSN by registering in the [RNI (non-residents records database)](https://www.netherlandsworldwide.nl/non-residents-records-database).
This requires a one-time in-person visit to any RNI desk in the Netherlands.

For the RNI in Amsterdam:
- Register for an appointment with [this online form](https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/civil-affairs/first-registration).
  Each member needs to have a separate appointment, but you can coordinate to select subsequent times.
- Enter your personal data into [this online form](https://rni-webform.rvig.nl/en) to get a QR code to take to the appointment.

Once you have a BSN, you can register for DigiD by following [these instructions](https://www.digid.nl/en/living-abroad).

## How to change board members

Board members can be changed by following [this online form](https://www.kvk.nl/en/report-a-change/register-change-or-remove-legal-entity-officials).
All board member are registered as directors (bestuurder) with joint authority (gezamenlijk bevoegd)
and their respective statutory title (such as chair, treasurer, secretary or other).

If the online process doesn't work for some reason, you can instead use form 22,
available [here](https://www.kvk.nl/en/about-the-business-register/download-form-22/) (English)
or [here](https://www.kvk.nl/over-het-handelsregister/formulier-22-functionarissen-inschrijven-van-vve-of-stichting-of-vereniging-zonder-onderneming/) (Dutch).
The form must be signed with pen by both the person registering the change and all new members,
and then be sent to the [KVK's address](https://www.kvk.nl/hulp-en-contact/postadressen/) along with copies of valid identity documents.

### UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owners) registration

The foundation's [UBOs](https://www.kvk.nl/english/registration/ubo-report/) must be kept in sync with the board members.

It is each members responsibility to ensure a UBO update is filed when the UBO details change within 7 days of the changes becoming official.
