# NixOS Foundation

The NixOS Foundation's role is to support the infrastructure and development of
the NixOS project as a whole. The exact nature and scope of this might vary
over time.

## Current scope

* Maintain the core infrastructure (Hydra, binary cache, ...)
* Pay for projects that improve the open source nixos ecosystem (security patching, a designer, etc.) but not do private work
* Hold various properties related to the project (Internet domains, ...)
