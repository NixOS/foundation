# Conflict of Interest Rule

Purpose: This conflict of interest rule aims to ensure that the foundation operates in an impartial and transparent manner, avoiding any conflicts of interest that may arise due to members' involvement in companies that benefit from the Nix ecosystem.

Members in this document apply to:
- Each member of the NixOS Foundation, as filled with the Kamer van Koophandel
- Each NixOS Foundation board observer
- Each key employee shall mean employees designated by the Board as a “Key Employee”  

Definition: For the purposes of this rule, a conflict of interest is any situation in which a member's personal, financial, or other interests conflict, or appear to conflict, with the interests of the foundation leading the NixOS project.

Guidelines:

1. Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest: All members must disclose any conflicts of interest to the foundation's board of directors and the project's governance body as soon as they become aware of them.

2. Recusal: Members with a conflict of interest must recuse themselves from any decision-making process or vote related to the project where the conflict of interest exists. The recusal should be documented in the project's meeting minutes.

3. Transparency: Members must disclose any conflicts of interest to the project's community. Members should avoid giving the impression that their personal interests influence the foundation's decision-making process.

4. Mitigation: Members with a conflict of interest may participate in discussions related to the project but must clearly disclose their conflicts of interest and refrain from advocating for their personal interests.

5. Consequences: Failure to comply with this conflict of interest rule will result in disciplinary action, including but not limited to removal from the foundation's board of directors or governance body.
